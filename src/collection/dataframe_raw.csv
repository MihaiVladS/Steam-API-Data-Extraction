Replace the old cannon's with shiny new blasters or replace rotten wood hull with gold plating, but the outside is not the only thing you can customize, Change the wallpaper or buy that super expensive king sized bed.

(Although this is not said in the main game). <br />
<br />
Each season presents itself with its own challenge.<br />
<br />
Summer:<br />
In Summer you will be faced with incredible heat to knock your spirit down.<br />
<br />
Autumn:<br />
In Autumn the leaves will blow in your face and you must be careful to not be blinded by them.<br />
<br />
Winter:<br />
In Winter you will have to tread through the harsh and cold snow.<br />
<br />
Spring:<br />
In Spring you will be surrounded by a lovely breeze but don't get too comfortable remember you still need to save the seasons!<br />
<br />
In the game, there are two different enemies that will stop you on your trail.<br />
<br />
The blocks and the maces. The blocks are square entities with spikes around them and angry eyes, while the maces are just maces that spin around in a circle. You will need to face both enemies in order to complete the level.<br />
<br />
In order to move to the next level you will need to get to the chest at the end of the level but be careful because some levels will take you off the path and mislead you with a fake chest.<br />
<br />
You will also find checkpoints around the level so when you die you will respawn at that checkpoint.<br />

The only remnants of its previous society were massive bio-domes dotted on the surface and designed as protection from the hostile climate.<br><br>With one side of the world bathed in eternal day and the other cloaked in frigid night, the bio-domes are oases where people live sheltered from the scorching winds and storms. But whether in the bright, clean cities of the day side of the planet, or the poor and crime-ridden cities of the night side, life is never simple nor peace easy to come by.<br><br>When a fateful encounter exposes Morgan Leone, a young woman who has long hid her ESP, as a queen ranked Esper, she finds herself on the run from multiple factions eager to attain her abilities. Endgame, the planetary defence organisation; Crimson, a notorious crime syndicate from Delphine; and even the shadowy group only known as &quot;the Host&quot; - each group sends operatives to retrieve her.<br><br>Now, with several paths open to her, she must choose her allies carefully.

The majority of the world is uninhabitable now and raiders roam the lands looking to steal everything they can from anyone passing by. There is one last habitable oasis, but getting there won’t be easy as it’s well guarded – you’ll need to bribe your way past guards and sneak past raiders as you attempt to get you and your brother to safety.<br><br>It takes around 30 minutes to play through Cold Sun and it really impresses with its high quality artwork, exceptional environmental detail and heartfelt narrative. The stealth mechanics are particularly well implemented – offering a nice amount of challenge, but also being forgiving enough to allow you to recover from mistakes.

Heroes of the past had stopped them, but they couldn’t destroy the Source. Inside the Ulm mountain this power was able to reshape dungeons to an endless labyrinth full of creatures of the dark. It also was able to revive demons countless times so they can’t be really killed. <br />
Some heroes drink demon blood in order to receive same power. Those who did not died, went deeply to the old dwarf kingdom in order to find and destroy Demon Source.<br />

Of course, it's fun to draw your own levels, so I encourage you to try them out!  <br><br>Currently supported features:  <br><ul class=""bb_ul""><li>Play over 100 official levels  <br></li><li>Play other players' levels  <br></li><li>Create your own level  <br></li><li>Choose different textures when creating levels  <br></li><li>Three levels of difficulty: 12x10, 18x14, and 24x20  <br></li><li>Sort by popularity, latest, play record, etc  <br></li><li>Uncompleted levels are shown in grey  <br></li><li>Give a like  <br></li><li>Collection  <br></li><li>Leaderboard of completion time  <br></li><li>The number of levels played worldwide and the pass rate  <br></li><li>Supports simplified Chinese, traditional Chinese, English, and Russian  </li></ul><br><br><strong>About me </strong> <br>I'm a game developer and I want to make fun games.  &quot;You draw I puzzle&quot; is the first game I tried outside of work and will always be free to play.  <br> <br>Indeed, at the beginning, I referred to PixelCraft, a mobile phone game, which is very interesting.  But somehow I couldn't open his &quot;My Level&quot; and &quot;Artist&quot; screens, and I still don't know what they looked like, so I designed them myself and added some new gameplay features.   <br> <br>I was the only one to make this game. I only knew how to write code, but I was not good at art, game design and operation and publicity.  However, I will try my best to improve the game and fix the bugs so as to bring you a better game experience. At the same time, I will accumulate experience for the game I want to make next. Thank you for your understanding and support.  <br><br>Next, I would like to add some innovative gameplay to the game, such as:  <br><ul class=""bb_ul""><li>Rotate the fragment randomly to increase the difficulty  <br></li><li>Added multiplayer matchups and timed challenges  <br></li><li>Added playback of other players' play sessions  <br></li><li>Improved editor features to make level building easier  </li></ul> <br>If you have better suggestions or ideas, feel free to leave a comment.  <br>Have fun!","&quot;You draw I puzzle&quot; is an interesting drawing Mosaic casual play, you can drag the graphics fragment to spell out the complete picture, can also draw the work that you like, cut into interesting fragments, let other players challenge your imaginative design.

<br />
Start a paranormal investigative career from your office in the town of New Eidolon. Initially the locations to investigate are limited, but by becoming more successful as a paranormal investigator you will be invited to new locations.<br />
<br />
Each new investigation randomly spawns a different type of ghost, and each ghost has unique behaviors which could vary your approach to investigating.  In general, an investigation will take less than an hour to obtain satisfactory evidence.<br />
<br />
During investigations you’re equipped with an Electromagnetic Field (EMF) Meter, a High-Tech Thermometer, an Audio Recorder, a Camera, and your trusty Flashlight.<br />
<br />
You will use your equipment to narrow down the haunted locations within the property and slowly obtain evidence. <br />
<br />
You can finalize your investigation as soon as you become suspicious of paranormal activity but doing so without substantial evidence will severely underwhelm the homeowner and prevent invitations to new locations. The best outcome for an investigation, is to spend the time obtaining as much evidence possible with the various pieces of equipment you have.","Conrad Stevenson’s Paranormal P.I. is a first-person single player ghost hunting simulation. <br />

This game does not wish to insinuate any ethnic disposition towards Covid-19, however it is personally important to me to demonstrate the extreme dangers that minorities are currently experiencing with the pandemic. It is impossible for a simple game to fully simulate the intricacies of every day human life.<br><br>The random ages, genders, health, and ethnicity is based on percentages reported in the US Census data for people in the work place.

This simulator/visualization appears to have similar outcomes to real world results - however it will likely never be real world accurate. It is only a game, meant to demonstrate the dangers of unchecked Covid-19 spread. Within the game files is a stat sheet which can be edited if you would like to change the outcomes/results! If you ARE a statistician or a virologist, please contact me - I would LOVE to expand the accuracy of this game.","COVID SIMULATOR is an outbreak simulation that visualizes how quickly Covid-19 spreads, becoming a disaster.

In the dystopian city of Athica, The Government rules over all. But, as the city sinks further into a financial crisis, The Government spend their last funds defending its repressive system.<h2 class=""bb_tag"">Current Content + Features</h2><strong>Current State</strong><br>Hexane is currently in early development stages, and not much of the open-world / story systems are implemented. There are only testing maps available, and the game plays more like a Sandbox title. However, all is subject to change, and obviously Hexane will be improving over time, and will gradually begin to reach our planned goals :D<br><br><strong>Visuals</strong><br>Currently almost all models are temporary. We are focusing on gameplay at the moment, and will be implementing actual player models, and the city map once we are happy with the game's feel.<br><br><strong>Combat</strong><br>NPCs in Hexane will fight back. Most pedestrians conceal carry, and are not afraid to use their weapons when they feel threatened. If they find a dead body, some will try to find out who killed them, and hunt the killer down. Some will also chase down attackers who escape their sights.<br><br><strong>Hysteria Motion Synthesis</strong><br>Our state-of-the-art motion synthesis system generates motion for Hexane's ragdolls on the fly, allowing advanced behaviours such as stumbling and wound grabbing. It is currently Work-In-Progress, and will be recieving many updates before we are happy with its state.<br><br><strong>Detailed Gore System</strong><br>Hexane features a very detailed gore system, with realistic bullet entry and exit wounds, blood dripping, and blood impacts. The gore system is planned to be expanded with a Skin Dripping shader, Dismemberment, location based effects, and much more.<br><br><strong>Driving</strong><br>Enter cars and drive around at incredibly fast speeds, drifting round corners and wiping out anyone who happens to be in front of the vehicle.<br><br><strong>Multiplayer</strong><br>You can join friends in the Online Co-Op system, and fight each other using the range of guns available, or gang up on NPCs. You can also share a ride and take one of the vehicles for a spin, and team up to take an amazing photo with the multiplayer-supported photomode.<br><br><strong>Take stunning screenshots with the in-game photomode</strong><br>The in-game photomode gives all control to the player, allowing them to free-fly around the map, and take screenshots with the wide range of settings and filters available. You can also unfreeze time and take cinematic videos of the world.<h2 class=""bb_tag"">Coming in the future</h2><strong>Explore the detailed city</strong><br>Navigate through the city, avoiding Authority and taking on missions from dealers. Missions take place all around Athica, and will require you to interact with many different people, some more friendly than others.<br><br><strong>Programs</strong><br>Programs can give you Defence, Attack, or Movement abilities that allow you to gain the upper hand in a fight, giving you the edge you need to bring down the opponents. <br><br><strong>Missions</strong><br>Sneak around Buildings and Bases to find information that will allow you to bring The Government down. You could clear out the entire area, or slink past every guard.

High qualiy gun dealers only sell to respectable people, and people will only want to join your movement if you are showing that you are helping them.","Hexane is a WORK-IN-PROGRESS open-world, action-adventure story game. In the dystopian city of Athica, The Government rules over all. But, as the city sinks further into a financial crisis, The Government spend their last funds defending its repressive system.<h2 class=""bb_tag"">Current Content + Features</h2><strong>Current State</strong><br>Hexane is currently in early development stages, and not much of the open-world / story systems are implemented. There are only testing maps available, and the game plays more like a Sandbox title. However, all is subject to change, and obviously Hexane will be improving over time, and will gradually begin to reach our planned goals :D<br><br><strong>Visuals</strong><br>Currently almost all models are temporary. We are focusing on gameplay at the moment, and will be implementing actual player models, and the city map once we are happy with the game's feel.<br><br><strong>Combat</strong><br>NPCs in Hexane will fight back. Most pedestrians conceal carry, and are not afraid to use their weapons when they feel threatened. If they find a dead body, some will try to find out who killed them, and hunt the killer down. Some will also chase down attackers who escape their sights.<br><br><strong>Hysteria Motion Synthesis</strong><br>Our state-of-the-art motion synthesis system generates motion for Hexane's ragdolls on the fly, allowing advanced behaviours such as stumbling and wound grabbing. It is currently Work-In-Progress, and will be recieving many updates before we are happy with its state.<br><br><strong>Detailed Gore System</strong><br>Hexane features a very detailed gore system, with realistic bullet entry and exit wounds, blood dripping, and blood impacts. The gore system is planned to be expanded with a Skin Dripping shader, Dismemberment, location based effects, and much more.<br><br><strong>Driving</strong><br>Enter cars and drive around at incredibly fast speeds, drifting round corners and wiping out anyone who happens to be in front of the vehicle.<br><br><strong>Multiplayer</strong><br>You can join friends in the Online Co-Op system, and fight each other using the range of guns available, or gang up on NPCs. You can also share a ride and take one of the vehicles for a spin, and team up to take an amazing photo with the multiplayer-supported photomode.<br><br><strong>Take stunning screenshots with the in-game photomode</strong><br>The in-game photomode gives all control to the player, allowing them to free-fly around the map, and take screenshots with the wide range of settings and filters available. You can also unfreeze time and take cinematic videos of the world.<h2 class=""bb_tag"">Coming in the future</h2><strong>Explore the detailed city</strong><br>Navigate through the city, avoiding Authority and taking on missions from dealers. Missions take place all around Athica, and will require you to interact with many different people, some more friendly than others.<br><br><strong>Programs</strong><br>Programs can give you Defence, Attack, or Movement abilities that allow you to gain the upper hand in a fight, giving you the edge you need to bring down the opponents. <br><br><strong>Missions</strong><br>Sneak around Buildings and Bases to find information that will allow you to bring The Government down. You could clear out the entire area, or slink past every guard.

Introduce yourself to the color wheel while utilizing spatial perception for some passively educational excitement. Stretch your mind to combine and separate primary and secondary colors on a journey that immerses you in tough challenges and satisfying sounds.<br />
<br />
How to play<br />
<br />
The objective is to connect the circuit between the laser's start point with the endpoint node of the corresponding color using the modules available.<br />
Take full control of a 360° rotational camera to see all the angles!<br />
Manipulate lasers in 3 dimensions to overcome obstacles and avoid other lasers to accomplish your goals.<br />
<br />
Challenges<br />
<br />
All starting lasers have a length of 10 meters (or 10-floor tiles) with each redirecting module adding 3 meters.<br />
Ensure you have enough laser to reach the node.<br />
Combine primary colors to create secondary colors or split secondary colors to create primary colors with a split/combiner module to acquire the needed color for the node.<br />
<br />
Stuck on a puzzle?<br />
<br />
With a non-linear progression system, simply move on to another puzzle, or for the truly determined use the built-in hint system to guide your way.<br />
Be warned, to use the hint system you must first collect the hint crystals. Many are easy to acquire but some may be more challenging than the puzzle itself!<br />

<br />
The post-war world was awful.<br />
<br />
The harsh conditions and the repeated witnessing of the most twisted side of human nature could make even the most optimistic person lose the will to survive.<br />
<br />
No one would believe it. With this in mind, I met Emma, a young girl who claimed to be a military robot. She asked to come with me and offered to give me everything she had.<br />
<br />
Emma was a strange, with little common sense, always expressionless, and even said that sex was a way to relieve stress. She even initiated physical contact with me and said she was used to it...<br />
<br />
What had she been through and what was she hiding?<br />
<br />
After I spent some time with Emma, she gradually took on a different look. The sadness in Emma's eyes was slowly revealed, and I began to enjoy her company, forgetting for a while that I was still in the middle of the doomsday.<br />
<br />
Suffering was approaching, should we face it or escape? The physical and psychological choices that we had to make were difficult.<br />
<br />
Could we really find hope in this desperate doomsday?<br />
<br />
◆Gameplay Instructions (will be open in the future)<br />
The game is a combination of exploration, basic combat and development simulation.<br />
At the beginning of the day, the player can choose a place to “explore”, to “chat” with Emma, or go further with “physical contact” to increase interaction. As the days pass, more events can be triggered. Differences in Emma's favorability and the player’s choices will lead to different futures.<br />
Remember, the world is ruined. Your surroundings will always remind you when you accidentally forget.","The world was destroyed, and the doomsday was here. I collapsed in the wasteland, short of food and water. Just as thought I was going to die, a young girl rescued me. Her name was Emma and she told me who she was--a military robot girl.","Traditional Chinese, English, Russian, Simplified Chinese, Korean, French, German, Spanish - Spain, Turkish, Japanese<strong>*</strong>, Thai, Portuguese, Portuguese -

Returning character artist Akio Watanabe and writer Ryuta Fujisaki bring you the last installment in the acclaimed Grisaia series, &quot;Grisaia: Phantom Trigger&quot;.<br>This is the final instalment in the Phantom Trigger series! What will become of the members of SORD at the end of this long, grueling battle?<br><strong>This final volume contains over three times as much text and voiced lines as the previous volumes.</strong><br><br>Story:<br>At last, an all-out war is at hand.<br><br>The battle against the religious organization, The Fatal Answer (TFA), has entered its final phase, with CIRS and SORD preparing to send all of their troops into TFA's stronghold.<br><br>The battlefield soon descends into total chaos. Black rain pours down, civilians become desperate for water, and shots are fired at friend and foe alike. Not even the trenches are safe from the anti-aircraft guns TFA employs, the explosions bombarding the combat zone that the girls are tasked with invading. Such a feat is not unlike invading the depths of hell itself.

Such a feat is not unlike invading the depths of hell itself.

Once you've collected all three lewd victory conditions, the girls will like you enough to have sex with you (male on female intercourse).

The girls can also send you photos to reward your victories or just for finding them on their rest days. Some of these photos are lewd in nature, and one includes girl on girl with penis oral sex..

Je kan dit spel in een team spelen of in je eentje. er zijn 8 verschillende maps waar je uit kan kiezen en 6 characters.",Dutch<strong>*</strong><br><strong>*</strong>languages with full audio support,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1869170/header.jpg?t=1644998536,,[],[],['PowerUp Universe'],['PowerUp Universe'],,[],"[{'id': 1, 'description': 'Multi-player'}, {'id': 49, 'description': 'PvP'}, {'id': 36, 'description': 'Online PvP'}, {'id': 15, 'description': 'Stats'}]","[{'id': '1', 'description': 'Action'}, {'id': '2', 'description': 'Strategy'}]","[{'id': 0, 'path_thumbnail': 'https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1869170/ss_b62ad64836b6e38caf4d5fe9814f448fe0b7a810.600x338.jpg?t=1644998536', 'path_full': 'https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1869170/ss_b62ad64836b6e38caf4d5fe9814f448fe0b7a810.1920x1080.jpg?t=1644998536'}, {'id': 1, 'path_thumbnail': 'https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1869170/ss_8e5dff38d0649e484a5acc69d63eb6c82acf18e6.600x338.jpg?t=1644998536', 'path_full': 'https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1869170/ss_8e5dff38d0649e484a5acc69d63eb6c82acf18e6.1920x1080.jpg?t=1644998536'}, {'id': 2, 'path_thumbnail': 'https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1869170/ss_8375a593563a2df1dd15a1af817a1c5b5d55c401.600x338.jpg?t=1644998536', 'path_full': 'https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1869170/ss_8375a593563a2df1dd15a1af817a1c5b5d55c401.1920x1080.jpg?t=1644998536'}, {'id': 3, 'path_thumbnail': 'https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1869170/ss_14f5644473e5aee4a70e4abeaefb7060f0ad3ee5.600x338.jpg?t=1644998536', 'path_full': 'https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1869170/ss_14f5644473e5aee4a70e4abeaefb7060f0ad3ee5.1920x1080.jpg?t=1644998536'}, {'id': 4, 'path_thumbnail': 'https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1869170/ss_a6c95af9e8005d24dae6c5aa3c2db42b5303bc2d.600x338.jpg?t=1644998536', 'path_full': 'https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1869170/ss_a6c95af9e8005d24dae6c5aa3c2db42b5303bc2d.1920x1080.jpg?t=1644998536'}]",https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1869170/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1644998536,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1869170/page.bg.jpg?t=1644998536,,,"<strong>Minimum:</strong><br><ul class=""bb_ul""><li><strong>OS:</strong> Windows 7 (SP1+)<br></li><li><strong>Processor:</strong> Intel(R) Core(TM) i5-4300M CPU @ 2.60GHz 2.59 GHz<br></li><li><strong>Memory:</strong> 4 GB RAM<br></li><li><strong>Graphics:</strong> GeForce GTX 1660<br></li><li><strong>Storage:</strong> 6 GB available space<br></li><li><strong>Sound Card:</strong> ASUS Xonar SE<br></li><li><strong>Additional Notes:</strong> -</li></ul>","<strong>Recommended:</strong><br><ul class=""bb_ul""><li><strong>OS:</strong> Windows 7 (SP1+)<br></li><li><strong>Processor:</strong> Intel(R) Core(TM) i5-4300M CPU @ 2.60GHz 2.59 GHz<br></li><li><strong>Memory:</strong> 4 GB RAM<br></li><li><strong>Graphics:</strong> GeForce GTX 1660<br></li><li><strong>Storage:</strong> 6 GB available space<br></li><li><strong>Sound Card:</strong> ASUS Xonar SE<br></li><li><strong>Additional Notes:</strong> -</li></ul>",,,,,,,True,False,False,True,Feb 2022,https://www.powerup-universe.com/,support@powerup-universe.com,[],,our_scraper,23/03/2022 03:24:43,,,,,,"[{'id': 256869550, 'name': 'PowerUp Party', 'thumbnail': 'https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256869550/movie.293x165.jpg?t=1644998527', 'webm': {'480': 'http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256869550/movie480_vp9.webm?t=1644998527', 'max': 'http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256869550/movie_max_vp9.webm?t=1644998527'}, 'mp4': {'480': 'http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256869550/movie480.mp4?t=1644998527', 'max': 'http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256869550/movie_max.mp4?t=1644998527'}, 'highlight': True}]",,,,,,,,,,,

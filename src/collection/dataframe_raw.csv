The Center started experimenting with virtual reality in late 2013 with the goal of capturing objects to share in exhibits and videos. Four years later, we have elevated our work to a whole new level. Website visitors can now download the project, “step into” The Cable Center's building and manipulate cable related artifacts in our virtual archives. You can experience watching our Oral History videos in the virtual John Malone Theater on the big screen. Or, be enveloped in a video in our 360 video theater. A downloadable version is available now for those with an HTC Vive headset, as well as a basic version in 2D for Windows desktop. The Oculus Rift version is coming soon.<br />

The temple features a main entrance and secret side entrances. Inside many other shrines are found, along with cells, high priests room, kitchen, larder and guardposts.<br><br><strong>The Dock</strong><br>This sewers dock is well protected by two sturdy portcullises. A nest of rooms, accessible via secret doors, surrounds the dock entrance. The rooms are provided of arrowslits to defend the entrance. Only small rowboats can access the dock, this due to the small size of the sewers channels, although it is told that smugglers can shrink the size of larger boats in order to unload precious cargoes of illegal goods in the storage rooms of the dock.</i><br><br>Each map is linked within an easy to follow outline story entry, with links to the map in mutliple resolutions.<br><br><i>Fantasy Grounds Conversion by</i> <strong>0one Games</strong><br><br>Released on February 05, 2010.

And, finally, how can we do to avoid becoming hopelessly lost in that damned sewers maze? Find it in Sewers Below!<br><br><strong>The Maze</strong><br>Many underground waterworks cross and connect themselves in this filthy maze. Some secret doors lead to mysterious chambers containing goods or leading to other places below the city.<br><br><strong>The Hideout</strong><br>Nobody is able to find this hideout whose secret entrance is hidden somewhere in the sewers maze below the city. A corridor encircles the whole hideout and lead to the actual entrance of the complex. Inside, a self-sufficient environment do exist, containing refectory, barracks, storage rooms, a fresh water well, and many other facilities.<br><br><strong>The Temple</strong><br>Someone whispers the sewers temple is devoted to a ratlike deity, others tell tales about unaware citizens drawn in the sewers and forever lost, maybe victim of horrid sacrifices. The temple features a main entrance and secret side entrances. Inside many other shrines are found, along with cells, high priests room, kitchen, larder and guardposts.<br><br><strong>The Dock</strong><br>This sewers dock is well protected by two sturdy portcullises. A nest of rooms, accessible via secret doors, surrounds the dock entrance. The rooms are provided of arrowslits to defend the entrance. Only small rowboats can access the dock, this due to the small size of the sewers channels, although it is told that smugglers can shrink the size of larger boats in order to unload precious cargoes of illegal goods in the storage rooms of the dock.</i><br><br>Each map is linked within an easy to follow outline story entry, with links to the map in mutliple resolutions.<br><br><i>Fantasy Grounds Conversion by</i> <strong>0one Games</strong><br><br>Released on February 05, 2010.

The test only takes 5 minutes, so if you're curious how your &quot;intelligence&quot; compares to other VR users, give it a try!<br />

We are open-sourcing the final score data (all anonymized) so that we can build an accurate distribution, just like a normal IQ test! Check out the 3DIQ blog to see how your score compares to others'. We'll also be comparing Vive and Oculus scores for some friendly competition.<br />

Note: Intelligence is a complex skill/ability. This test is merely one indicator of comparative problem solving ability in a VR scenario, so don't feel discouraged if you get a low score. You'll have a chance to redeem yourself in future tests, and each test you take will help hone your problem solving skills!<br />

Cryptocracy is a game that can make you sit up and take a notice about how our modern society is organized and who really runs it.<br />
If you have no problem with imagination, the game can show you who is behind the curtain…<br />
Of course, you will need help to understand it​ all, so here comes one former zillionaire and power broker, who was nicely set up by his colleagues. Together you will manipulate people and look forward to tons of money and influence!<br />
<br />
A gameplay is based on 2 different classic match mechanics - one you need to gain power and money, the other one is to confront protesters (nobody said that to rule the world is easy).<br />
<br />
Features:<br />
- the unique twist on Match-3 puzzle<br />
- 20 cool animated characters<br />
- brain-challenging story mode <br />
- endless mode to compete with other players<br />
- hero customization <br />
<br />
For now, you have 6 cities - to get each one, at first, you need to take control over resources and then​ handle with discontented people.<br />
<br />
In nearest future, we plan to make more levels with new heroes!<br />

0,game,Task Force,611300,0,False,"<h1>Workshop Support</h1><p>Task Force provides modders with the ability to upload and play custom maps on dedicated servers all completely in-game without any third-party services. After a UE4 map is uploaded using our built-in workshop tool, modders can create their own custom lobby and add any subscribed workshop maps to the server map list.</p><br><h1>Controller Support</h1><p>All controller sensitivities, deadzones, and buttons are customizable through the in-game menu. There’s also support for creating controller-only rooms. This removes the ability to use a mouse and restricts input to joysticks only. The controller-only option is available when creating a custom server and will display a special icon in the server browser.</p><br><h1>About the Game</h1>Task Force is a tactical shooter that focuses on close quarters infantry combat. It aims to provide competitive arcade-style gameplay inspired by classic third-person games. Maps will include locations around the world where special operations are conducted. These could be jungles, deserts, urban areas or snowy environments. They'll be designed around single-life game modes with mechanics involving either bombs, hostages, or intel.<br><br>There are NO plans to include any of the following in Task Force:<br>- NO Health Regeneration<br>- NO Weapon Unlocks<br>- NO Enemy Targeting (UAV)<br>- NO Character Progression<br>- NO Killstreaks, Deathstreaks, or Perks<br>- NO Drivable Vehicles (Coop Only)<br>- NO Unrealistic Skins<br><br><strong>TACTICAL THIRD-PERSON GAMEPLAY</strong><br>Gameplay focuses on close quarters infantry combat where communication and teamwork are required. Expanding crosshairs provide a sense of weapon inaccuracy which is affected by recoil, stance, movement, and a few other factors. It rewards bursting by keeping tighter shots more precise while still allowing for accurate spray.<br><br><strong>STRATEGIC ROUND-BASED GAME MODES</strong><br>Game modes are round-based and mostly focus on single-life objectives. They’ll involve aspects such as planting or defusing bombs, extracting or guarding hostages, and capturing or defending intel. Each map will be designed to a specific game mode but may also have different areas sectioned off for different modes.<br><br><strong>COMPETITIVE LEAGUES AND RANKINGS</strong><br>Automated ladders and tournaments are integrated directly into the game. Players are provided with a detailed stats profile and a global ranking based on competitive performance. Servers are automatically created for scheduled matches and will instantly report game information upon match completion.<br><br><strong>CUSTOM USER-CREATED LOBBIES</strong><br>Servers are organized based on region and players have the ability to create their own lobbies directly in-game. These custom lobbies provide access to a robust set of management tools such as restricting players to friends-only or clan-only. It also allows for region-locking servers and automatically kicking high ping players.","Task Force is a tactical shooter that focuses on close quarters infantry combat.
